# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) SEI45 - Project 01
My first project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. It is a static web application based on the popular arcade game Space Invaders.

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Clone this repository by running the terminal command: `git clone git@github.com:bheki-maenetja/sei-project-1.git`
- Open the index.html file in a web browser of your choice

### Deployment
- You can view the deployed version of the webapp [here](https://bheki-maenetja.github.io/sei-project-1/)

## Project Overview
### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

### Approach
Although the project brief suggested that the project should be a grid-based game, rather than using a grid, the game works by adding and removing objects that are positioned absolutely within a DOM container. The objects are then animated by calling functions that adjust their position relative to the container.
 
## How It Works
The game is a Star Wars themed implementation of the popular arcade game Space Invaders. A player chooses their desired difficulty. When the game begins the player will have a finite amount of ammo (and lives) to shoot down multiple waves of approaching aliens. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the aliens before they destroy the city. The player get points for each alien kill and bonus points for each Darth Vader kill.
